                            <p>Coblic is a passionate and efficient public relations company with a focus on helping businesses attract customers through social media. The company targets small businesses local to the Santa Monica area that do not have time to manage developed social media sites. We are a small company, but hope to gain clients, and expand. However, we intend to keep our focus, helping new and small businesses with reaching new target audiences, rather than large 
established corporations.</p>
